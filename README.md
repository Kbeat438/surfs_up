#Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to view temperature data from June and December to verify ice cream and surfing is viable year round.


#Results: 
-December has highs of 83 and lows of 56, but because only 25% of the temperatures are below 69, it seems to be hot enough most days in decemeber for ice cream.
-June has highs of 85 and lows of 64, but the average is near 75 and that is where most temperatures fall so it seems like ideal weather for ice cream.
-the highs for decemeber and June are pretty similar, but december has the colder temperature by 8 degrees. Frankly from a wisconsin stand point tho, both of the months have 75% of their totals above 69 and 73 respectively which is ideal weather for ice cream.  


#Summary: Based on the results i would conclude that an ice cream and surf shop is viable all times of year just from atleast 75% of the temperatures in each month being viable surfing and ice cream weather.
More analysis would be helpful since temperature is not the only statistic that would help in this case. The two biggest queries that would help would be looking at the same month data from humidity(since it plays a big role in if people want to be in water or get ice cream) and wind speed (because that will influence the waves and viability of surfing)
